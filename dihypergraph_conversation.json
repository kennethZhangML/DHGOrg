GNNs encode prior knowledge in the form of a graph structure, and then feed data through a series of \"message passing\" layers to extract meaningful features and representations from the data. Each node in the graph can be associated with a vector representation which is interacted with messages between the nodes. By passing messages between nodes, GNNs are able to learn patterns and relationships in the data in order to arrive at better decisions."
